            <h2>Style of Play</h2>
                <p>
                A playmaker who operated in the classic number 10 position, Maradona's exceptional vision, passing, ball control, dribbling skills, speed, reflexes and thinking time 
                combined with his small size (5'5") allowed him to be more maneuverable than other football players.

                Maradona's reputation for his ability to keep the ball close to his feet resulted in many targetted fouls by opposing teams.

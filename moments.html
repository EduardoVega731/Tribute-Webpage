                <p>Maradona was renown for his pre-game showmanship, goalscoring ability, ball control
                and an aptitude for creating scoring opportunities for himself and his teammates. However, Maradona was
                also known for his controversial moments.</p>
                <p>
                Thus, it is no surprise that Maradona's talents and trickery produced moments that football fans
                recognize as some of the most memorable in the history of the game.

                    <figcaption>Maradona's goal vs Real Madrid resulted
                        in a standing ovation from rival fans. He was the first player to receive an ovation
                        from Real Madrid fans. Only two FC Barcelona players have received 
                        ovations from Real Madrid fans after Maradona; Ronaldinho in 2005 and Andres Iniesta in 2015. 
                        This is significant due to the historic rivalry between the two clubs. (1983)

                        Maradona was directly involved in a mass brawl at the 1984 Copa del Rey Final.
                        Athletic Bilbao's Miguel Sola provoked Maradona at full time as Barcelona lost 1–0. Maradona snapped and the two exchanged words. 
                        Maradona headbutted Sola, elbowed a Bilbao player in the face and attacking another player with his knee, knocking him out cold. 
                        This would be the last time Maradona ever put on an FC Barcelona shirt.
